/** \file Support library for invoking host services from the device.

 *  The hostcall consumer defined here is used by the language runtime
 *  to serve requests originating from kernels running on GPU
 *  devices. A typical flow is as follows:
 *
 *  - Create and launch one or more hostcall consumers.
 *  - Create and initialize a hostcall buffer per command queue.
 *  - Register these buffers with the appropriate consumer.
 *  - When a buffer is no longer used, deregister and then free it.
 *  - Destroy the consumer(s) when they are no longer required. Must be
 *    done before exiting the application, so that the consumer
 *    threads can join() correctly.
 *
 *  For a more information, see the accompanying README and the
 *  comments associated with each of the API functions.
