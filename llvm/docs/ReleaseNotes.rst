Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure,
release 11.0.0.  Here we describe the status of LLVM, including major improvements
from the previous release, improvements in various subprojects of LLVM, and
some of the current users of the code.  All LLVM releases may be downloaded
from the `LLVM releases web site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about LLVM, including information about the latest
release, please check out the `main LLVM web site <https://llvm.org/>`_.  If you
have questions or comments, the `LLVM Developer's Mailing List
<https://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo/llvm-dev>`_ is a good place to send
them.

Note that if you are reading this file from a Git checkout or the main
LLVM web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not the current
one.  To see the release notes for a specific release, please see the `releases
page <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

Deprecated and Removed Features/APIs
=================================================
* BG/Q support, including QPX, will be removed in the 12.0.0 release.

Non-comprehensive list of changes in this release
=================================================
.. NOTE
   For small 1-3 sentence descriptions, just add an entry at the end of
   this list. If your description won't fit comfortably in one bullet
   point (e.g. maybe you would like to give an example of the
   functionality, or simply have a lot to talk about), see the `NOTE` below
   for adding a new subsection.

* The LLVM project has started the migration towards Python 3, and the build
  system now prefers Python 3 whenever available.  If the Python 3 interpreter
  (or libraries) are not found, the build system will, for the time being, fall
  back to Python 2.  It is recommended that downstream projects migrate to
  Python 3 as Python 2 has been end-of-life'd by the Python Software
  Foundation.

* The llgo frontend has been removed for now, but may be resurrected in the
  future.

* ...


.. NOTE
   If you would like to document a larger change, then you can add a
   subsection about it right here. You can copy the following boilerplate
   and un-indent it (the indentation causes it to be inside this comment).

   Special New Feature
   -------------------

   Makes programs 10x faster by doing Special New Thing.


Changes to the LLVM IR
----------------------

* The callsite attribute `vector-function-abi-variant
  <https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#call-site-attributes>`_ has been
  added to describe the mapping between scalar functions and vector
  functions, to enable vectorization of call sites. The information
  provided by the attribute is interfaced via the API provided by the
  ``VFDatabase`` class. When scanning through the set of vector
  functions associated with a scalar call, the loop vectorizer now
  relies on ``VFDatabase``, instead of ``TargetLibraryInfo``.

* `dereferenceable` attributes and metadata on pointers no longer imply
  anything about the alignment of the pointer in question. Previously, some
  optimizations would make assumptions based on the type of the pointer. This
  behavior was undocumented. To preserve optimizations, frontends may need to
  be updated to generate appropriate `align` attributes and metadata.

* The DIModule metadata is extended to contain file and line number
  information. This information is used to represent Fortran modules debug
  info at IR level.

* LLVM IR now supports two distinct ``llvm::FixedVectorType`` and
  ``llvm::ScalableVectorType`` vector types, both derived from the
  base class ``llvm::VectorType``. A number of algorithms dealing with
  IR vector types have been updated to make sure they work for both
  scalable and fixed vector types. Where possible, the code has been
  made generic to cover both cases using the base class. Specifically,
  places that were using the type ``unsigned`` to count the number of
  lanes of a vector are now using ``llvm::ElementCount``. In places
  where ``uint64_t`` was used to denote the size in bits of a IR type
  we have partially migrated the codebase to using ``llvm::TypeSize``.

* Branching on ``undef``/``poison`` is undefined behavior. It is needed for
  correctly analyzing value ranges based on branch conditions. This is
  consistent with MSan's behavior as well.

* ``memset``/``memcpy``/``memmove`` can take ``undef``/``poison`` pointer(s)
  if the size to fill is zero.

* Passing ``undef``/``poison`` to a standard I/O library function call
  (`printf`/`fputc`/...) is undefined behavior. The new ``noundef`` attribute
  is attached to the functions' arguments. The full list is available at
  ``llvm::inferLibFuncAttributes``.

Changes to building LLVM
------------------------

Changes to the AArch64 Backend
------------------------------

* Back up and restore x18 in functions with windows calling convention on
  non-windows OSes.

* Clearly error out on unsupported relocations when targeting COFF, instead
  of silently accepting some (without being able to do what was requested).

* Implemented codegen support for the SVE C-language intrinsics
  documented in `Arm C Language Extensions (ACLE) for SVE
  <https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100987/>`_ (version
  ``00bet5``). For more information, see the ``clang`` 11 release
  notes.

* Added support for Armv8.6-A:

  Assembly support for the following extensions:
  - Enhanced Counter Virtualization (ARMv8.6-ECV).
  - Fine Grained Traps (ARMv8.6-FGT).
  - Activity Monitors virtualization (ARMv8.6-AMU).
  - Data gathering hint (ARMv8.0-DGH).

  Assembly and intrinsics support for the Armv8.6-A Matrix Multiply extension
  for Neon and SVE vectors.

  Support for the ARMv8.2-BF16 BFloat16 extension. This includes a new C-level
  storage-only `__bf16` type, a `BFloat` IR type, a `bf16` MVT, and assembly
  and intrinsics support.

* Added support for Cortex-A34, Cortex-A77, Cortex-A78 and Cortex-X1 cores.

Changes to the ARM Backend
--------------------------

* Implemented C-language intrinsics for the full Arm v8.1-M MVE instruction
  set. ``<arm_mve.h>`` now supports the complete API defined in the Arm C
  Language Extensions.

* Added support for assembly for the optional Custom Datapath Extension (CDE)
  for Arm M-profile targets.

* Implemented C-language intrinsics ``<arm_cde.h>`` for the CDE instruction set.

* Clang now defaults to ``-fomit-frame-pointer`` when targeting non-Android
  Linux for arm and thumb when optimizations are enabled. Users that were
  previously not specifying a value and relying on the implicit compiler
  default may wish to specify ``-fno-omit-frame-pointer`` to get the old
  behavior. This improves compatibility with GCC.

* Added support for Armv8.6-A:

  Assembly and intrinsics support for the Armv8.6-A Matrix Multiply extension
  for Neon vectors.

  Support for the ARMv8.2-AA32BF16 BFloat16 extension. This includes a new
  C-level storage-only `__bf16` type, a `BFloat` IR type, a `bf16` MVT, and
  assembly and intrinsics support.

* Added support for CMSE.

* Added support for Cortex-M55, Cortex-A77, Cortex-A78 and Cortex-X1 cores.

Changes to the MIPS Target
--------------------------

During this release ...


Changes to the PowerPC Target
-----------------------------

During this release ...

Changes to the RISC-V Target
----------------------------

New features:
* After consultation through an RFC, the RISC-V backend now accepts patches for
  proposed instruction set extensions that have not yet been ratified.  For these
  experimental extensions, there is no expectation of ongoing support - the
  compiler support will continue to change until the specification is finalised.
  In line with this policy, MC layer and code generation support was added for
  version 0.92 of the proposed Bit Manipulation Extension and MC layer support
  was added for version 0.8 of the proposed RISC-V Vector instruction set
  extension. As these extensions are not yet ratified, compiler support will
  continue to change to match the specifications until they are finalised.
* ELF attribute sections are now created, encoding information such as the ISA
  string.
* Support for saving/restoring callee-saved registers via libcalls (a code
  size optimisation).
* llvm-objdump will now print branch targets as part of disassembly.

Improvements:
* If an immediate can be generated using a pair of `addi` instructions, that
  pair will be selected rather than materialising the immediate into a
  separate register with an `lui` and `addi` pair.
* Multiplication by a constant was optimised.
* `addi` instructions are now folded into the offset of a load/store instruction
  even if the load/store itself has a non-zero offset, when it is safe to do
  so.
* Additional target hooks were implemented to minimise generation of
  unnecessary control flow instruction.
* The RISC-V backend's load/store peephole optimisation pass now supports
  constant pools, improving code generation for floating point constants.
* Debug scratch register names `dscratch0` and `dscratch1` are now recognised in
  addition to the legacy `dscratch` register name.
* Codegen for checking isnan was improved, removing a redundant `and`.
* The `dret` instruction is now supported by the MC layer.
* `.option pic` and `.option nopic` are now supported in assembly and `.reloc`
  was extended to support arbitrary relocation types.
* Scheduling info metadata was improved.
* The `jump` pseudo instruction is now supported.

Bug fixes:
* A failure to insert indirect branches in position independent code
  was fixed.
* The calculated expanded size of atomic pseudo operations was fixed, avoiding
  "fixup value out of range" errors during branch relaxation for some inputs.
* The `mcountinhibit` CSR is now recognised.
* The correct libcall is now emitted for converting a float/double to a 32-bit
  signed or unsigned integer on RV64 targets lacking the F or D extensions.


Changes to the X86 Target
-------------------------

During this release ...


* Functions with the probe-stack attribute set to "inline-asm" are now protected
  against stack clash without the need of a third-party probing function and
  with limited impact on performance.
* -x86-enable-old-knl-abi command line switch has been removed. v32i16/v64i8
  vectors are always passed in ZMM register when avx512f is enabled and avx512bw
  is disabled.
* Vectors larger than 512 bits with i16 or i8 elements will be passed in
  multiple ZMM registers when avx512f is enabled. Previously this required
  avx512bw otherwise they would split into multiple YMM registers. This means
  vXi16/vXi8 vectors are consistently treated the same as
  vXi32/vXi64/vXf64/vXf32 vectors of the same total width.
* Support was added for Intel AMX instructions.
* Support was added for TSXLDTRK instructions.
* A pass was added for mitigating the Load Value Injection vulnerability.
* The Speculative Execution Side Effect Suppression pass was added which can
  be used to as a last resort mitigation for speculative execution related
  CPU vulnerabilities.
* Improved recognition of boolean vector reductions with better MOVMSKB/PTEST
  handling
* Exteded recognition of rotation patterns to handle funnel shift as well,
  allowing us to remove the existing x86-specific SHLD/SHRD combine.

Changes to the AMDGPU Target
-----------------------------

* The backend default denormal handling mode has been switched to on
  for all targets for all compute function types. Frontends wishing to
  retain the old behavior should explicitly request f32 denormal
  flushing.

Changes to the AVR Target
-----------------------------

* Moved from an experimental backend to an official backend. AVR support is now
  included by default in all LLVM builds and releases and is available under
  the "avr-unknown-unknown" target triple.

Changes to the WebAssembly Target
---------------------------------

* Programs which don't have a "main" function, called "reactors" are now
  properly supported, with a new `-mexec-model=reactor` flag. Programs which
  previously used `-Wl,--no-entry` to avoid having a main function should
  switch to this new flag, so that static initialization is properly
  performed.

* `__attribute__((visibility("protected")))` now evokes a warning, as
  WebAssembly does not support "protected" visibility.

Changes to the Windows Target
-----------------------------

* Produce COFF weak external symbols for IR level weak symbols without a comdat
  (e.g. for `__attribute__((weak))` in C)

Changes to the OCaml bindings
-----------------------------



Changes to the C API
--------------------


Changes to the Go bindings
--------------------------


Changes to the DAG infrastructure
---------------------------------

* A SelDag-level freeze instruction has landed. It is simply lowered as a copy
  operation to MachineIR, but to make it fully correct either IMPLICIT_DEF
  should be fixed or the equivalent FREEZE operation should be added to
  MachineIR.

Changes to the Debug Info
---------------------------------

* LLVM now supports the debug entry values (DW_OP_entry_value) production for
  the x86, ARM, and AArch64 targets by default. Other targets can use
  the utility by using the experimental option ("-debug-entry-values").
  This is a debug info feature that allows debuggers to recover the value of
  optimized-out parameters by going up a stack frame and interpreting the values
  passed to the callee. The feature improves the debugging user experience when
  debugging optimized code.

Changes to the LLVM tools
---------------------------------

* Added an option (--show-section-sizes) to llvm-dwarfdump to show the sizes
  of all debug sections within a file.

* llvm-nm now implements the flag ``--special-syms`` and will filter out special
  symbols, i.e. mapping symbols on ARM and AArch64, by default. This matches
  the GNU nm behavior.

* llvm-rc now tolerates -1 as menu item ID, supports the language id option
  and allows string table values to be split into multiple string literals

* llvm-lib supports adding import library objects in addition to regular
  object files
